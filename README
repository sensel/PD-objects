Sensel Purr-Data (and Pure-Data) external for interfacing with the Sensel Morph
by and Rachel Hachem <rachelly@vt.edu> and Dr. Ivica Ico Bukvic <ico@vt.edu>

2020-04-18 Version 1.0 -- Initial release.


To build for Purr-Data (pd-vanilla setup may be similar with some subtle changes in the include paths and likely does not require MSYS environment, so on Windows changes may be more significant):



1) Set up a build environment:

On Windows follow instructions on setting up the MSYS2 environment for Purr-Data (make sure it matches your OS in terms of 32-bit vs 64-bit--most modern iterations of Windows are 64-bit). Info on how to do this can be found here: https://github.com/agraef/purr-data/blob/master/README.md#windows-32-bit-using-msys2

On Linux and OSX make sure you have your build gcc environment all set up (consult the OS documentation)



2) Install the Sensel lib for your OS found at https://github.com/sensel/sensel-api/tree/master/sensel-install



3) Using a terminal (in Windows use the MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit shell) go into this folder and run the following command (these options are assuming you have everything installed in a default path--if you don't you will need to adjust paths accordingly):

Linux: make pdincludepath=/usr/include/pd-l2ork/

OSX: make pdincludepath=/Applications/Pd-l2ork.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/include/pd-l2ork/

Windows: make pdincludepath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Purr\ Data/include/pdl2ork pdbinpath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Purr\ Data/bin/

Please note, because we are currently unaware of a universal way for Windows to locate the Sensel libraries where they are installed, we are including the latest version of the Windows Sensel libraries in this folder to allow the external to run on Windows. As of this writing, the included Windows library version is 0.8.3.



4) If everything compiles correctly, you should be able to run Purr-Data and open the sensel-help.pd to test it out. You can also move the sensel external, its help file, and in case of Windows, the four files copied in Step 3, to any desired location. Please note, if you wish to have Purr-Data auto-detect the presence of the sensel external and its help file, you should put it in a location that Purr-Data sees, or change path settings for Purr-Data.



Currently, the external only supports detecting of individual contact points and their traits. Future revisions should focus on outputting the grayscale matrix of the surface pressure in a Gem-compatible format (and/or using other Pure-Data-compatible matrix formats that may be used by alternative visual data processing libraries).
